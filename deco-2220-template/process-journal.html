                <p> We have grouped in the first week and then we discussed the first assignment. We were going to design an application for the drone delivery. Therefore I did some background research on drone delivery. In the research, I found delivery drone is an unmanned aerial vehicle that used to transport packages, food or other goods. Earlier prototypes of food delivery drones include the Tacocopter is a taco delivery concept utilizing a smartphone app to order drone-delivered tacos in San Francisco area. Drone delivery may be faster and cheaper than existing delivery methods. In China, the drone delivery service mainly delivers between two distribution points. Two staff members are responsible for placing the food on the drone and delivering the food to the consumer. Drone flight distance is about 70% of the total distance, which could greatly reduce the delivery time and also can reduce the meal price.</p>

                <p>In the second week, I used the questionnaire and interview method to find the advantages and disadvantages of food delivery, then I summarized and analyzed these data. I made a chart by using the data from the questionnaires so that I can find out the advantages and disadvantages of the food delivery more intuitively. At the beginning, I only asked 10 people to do the questionnaire, but I found that 10 people could not comprehensively analyze the food delivery, so I went looking for more people to complete the questionnaire. Therefore, my data could be more abundant and comprehensive. So, in the future, I need to find more people to complete the questionnaire. But I found that the questionnaire could only give me the basic data and could not give me a deeper view. So I found three people to do an interview.These interviews can give me a more intuitive view, but during the interview, I found that the questions I interviewed were not deep enough so that I could not get better data analysis. Secondly, my interviewees are all students so that the data is too one-sided. Therefore, in future interviews, people from different walks of life need to be involved in the interviews to make the interviews more detailed. This will make the interview data more practical.<br>

                <p>During my third week of study, I summarized the questionnaires and interviews which I made in the second week. I selected two interviewees to create personas when I doing the personas, I found that everyone has a different view of food delivery, but they all think that food delivery has changed their lives. The production of personas gives me a more detailed understanding of different people’s view, personas production can better help us to analyze the problems. After that, I selected personas to make a storyboard. I drew a total of 11 pictures to show the problems with food delivery. In the process of making it, I found that storyboard is a better way to present problems and make them more intuitive and easy to understand. But my level of painting is limited, so I can’t express all the problems and plots well. Thus, in the future, I hope I could strengthen my painting ability so that I can better show my ideas.

                <p>In the fourth week of study, the teacher told us that our concept was an existing product. So we need to change a new concept. So before we changed the new concept, our team members did the brainstorm. I came up with 10 ideas during the process, and I shared those ideas with my team numbers. After discussion, we decided on two big concepts. The first concept was using drones to deliver books, and the second was using the auto trolley to help librarians manage shelves. After that, I did research on the second concept. During this weeks study, I learned how to express my ideas in groups, and then how to communicate and collaborate better with other team members. I also learned how to use brainstorm to stimulate my ideas, and hope to better use these learning methods in future learning.</p>

                <p>Because our group changed concept in the fourth week, so I had to redo background research and interview in the fifth week. Firstly I did the background research. I found a company called Zookal and Zookal delivered its first textbook by a drone on October 23， 2013 at the University of Sydney, on the anniversary of the first human flight over 25 metres. But the drone delivery service, which will be called Flirty, will not be available to Zookal customers until March. And Textbook delivery can occur within two to three minutes by drones, rather than two to three days by post. The drone delivery of books will greatly shorten the delivery time so that readers can read the books they want as soon as possible. Then I went to the library to interview the librarian, and I asked the librarian about his job and his thought about the drone delivery of books in the future. I found that most librarians have been unable to find books, and they spend a lot of time on tidying up bookshelves. They think it would be easier for their job by using the drone to tiny up bookshelves and delivering books. Because many librarians don't allow me to take pictures, I don't have many pictures of interviews. But this interview gave me a chance to know about how librarians work, their work process, what problems they have in their work and how they think about our ideas.</p>

Compared with the last storyboard, this storyboard is more concise and I adding more details to it. After that, we have a group meeting. After discussion, we decided using the other team member’s storyboard, but they also got some idea from my storyboard. In this discussion, I learned that my storyboard was not good enough. There are some important ideas that didn’t fit well into the storyboard, So I am going to do better with the storyboard in the future.

I made 11 pages for our app based on the features that appear in storyboard and then I put the 11 pages I made into an application named “pop”. This can give users a better experience of my application. In the process of doing a low fi prototype, I also collected some information on the Internet and then I asked my friends for advice on my design. They said that the location of the auto trolley should be displayed in my design so that the librarian could manage it easily. So I added the location page in my app so that the user could see the location of the auto trolley. After a group discussion, our group didn’t use my low fi prototype. We integrated our idea and then we made a better low fi prototype. During this week study, I learned how to do a low fi prototype, this step gives us a more intuitive understanding of the problems that users have when using the app and gives us a better room to modify our app.</p>

                <p>In week nine, we did the second assignment. First of all, I introduced the functionality of each page. I summarized the user experience test results from last week, after that I wrote about usability testing. And then, in think aloud I recorded the problems that users had in the test and their views and opinions of the product. Finally, we summarized the whole testing process. During this weeks study, I learned how to analyze problems and make usability testing, through usability testing and think aloud to find out the existing problems in our app and then in the next step to modify and improve the app.</p>

                <p>We have group meeting at the begin of week ten, we made a final summary of what we had done in the last few weeks, and then we revised our respective sections after that we edited the layout of the report. In the meantime, I did design matrix, through design matrix, I gave each design a different score. With these scores we could compare which designs are better. Finally, we decided to use the “pigeon 2.0”. What I learned from this week allowed me to integrate what I had done in the previous few weeks and I also learned how to use design matrix to evaluate a design.</p>

                <p>In week 11 tutorial, our team members asked tutor how to improve our hi-fi prototype, Tutor told us we could use iPhone UI kit to make our prototype more real. We also need to add text to our hi-fi prototype, unify our button, adjust the font and the colour and unify all the button formats so that it would look more beautiful.</p>
